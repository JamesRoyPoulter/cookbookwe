CookBook App

We need to create a Rails app that models a cookbook's behaviour, to allow users to look at recipes, and see ingredients needed and cooking directions.

We will at least need to have a Recipe model and its CRUD actions, and an Ingredient model with its CRUD actions.

An individual recipe can have lots of ingredients, and an Ingredient can be used on lots of recipes, so you need to determine a database structure that supports this.

Additionally, extend the functionality in directions you think are appropriate (and within reach of the skills we've covered in class):

- Maybe recipes need to be assigned to an "author"

- Maybe the Recipe Author has written lots of recipes...

- Recipes could get collected into anthologies of "Cookbooks", and maybe that Cookbook is

only allowed to be accessed by users who have a Subscription to it... (the permissions checking we've not done... but we could certainly set up the DB tables to store whether a given user has access to a certain Recipe...)
